## Communication 3

### Sets
- $F$ - set of supplying farms
- $S:$ Supply
- $F:$ Fat

### Data
- $O_{f}$ - farm being organic (binary)
- $O_{w}$ - price of organic whole milk ($/L)
- $O_{l}$ - price of organic low fat milk ($/L)
- $C_{w}$ - price of whole milk ($/L)
- $C_{l}$ - price of low fat milk ($/L)
- $F_{w}$ - fat content of whole milk (%)
- $F_{l}$ - fat content of low fat milk (%)
- $S_{f}$ - supply from each farm $f \in F$ (L)
- $F_{f}$ - fat content of milk from each farm $f \in F$ (%)

### Variables
- $x_{f}$ - volume of normal whole milk produced from farm $f \in F$ (L)
- $y_{f}$ - volume of organic whole milk produced from farm $f \in F$ (L) 
- $z_{f}$ - volume of organic low fat milk produced from farm $f \in F$ (L) 

### Objective function
The goal is to determine the required volumes of milk to be processed such that the overall income is maximised. 
$$
\textrm{max}(\sum_{f \in F} 
    O_{w} \times y_{f} + 
    O_{l} \times z_{f}) +
    C_{w} \times x_{f} + 
    C_{l} \times (S_{f} - x_{f} - y_{f} - z_{f})
$$

### Constraints
- The supplied milk is processed into whole milk and low fat milk so that the total milk fat content of production is at most the total milk fat of supply - excess milk fat can be potentially used for other purposes.
$$
\sum_{f \in F} 
    F_{w} \times (x_{f} + y_{f}) + 
    F_{l} \times (S_{f} - x_{f} - y_{f}) \leq 
    \sum_{f \in F} S_{f} \times F_{f}
$$

- The percentage milk fat in organic products must be less than or equal to the percentage milk fat of their supply (since organic products can only be produced from organic supply).
$$
\sum_{f \in F} F_{w} \times y_{f} + F_{l} \times z_{f} \leq 
\sum_{f \in F \textrm{if} f \textrm{ organic}} S_{f} \times F_{f}$$

- The production of organic whole milk from a farm should be at most its supply minus its production of organic low fat milk, if it's an organic farm.
$$\forall f \in F,\; 0 \leq P_{owf} \leq S_f \times O_f-P_{olf}$$

- The production of normal whole milk from a farm should be at most its supply minus its production of organic milk - both whole & low fat.
$$\forall f \in F,\; 0 \leq P_{wf} \, \leq S_f-P_{owf}-P_{olf}$$

- The low fat milk can make up at most 25% of the total of low fat and whole milk, for each of organic and normal products.
$$\sum_{f \in F} P_{owf} \geq 3  \times  \sum_{f \in F} P_{olf}$$
$$\sum_{f \in F} P_{wf} \geq 3  \times  \sum_{f \in F} (S_f-P_{wf}-P_{owf}-P_{olf})$$

- Organic products can make up at most 15% of all milk sold.
$$\sum_{f \in F} (P_{owf}+P_{olf}) \leq 0.15  \times  \sum_{f \in F} S_f$$
