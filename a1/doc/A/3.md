### Sets
- $Farms$
- $S:$ Supply
- $F:$ Fat

### Data
- $O_f$ - Farm being organic (binary)
- $O_w$ - Price of organic whole milk ($/L)
- $O_l$ - Price of organic low fat milk ($/L)
- $C_w$ - price of whole milk ($/L)
- $C_l$ - price of low fat milk ($/L)
- $F_w$ - fat of whole milk (%)
- $F_l$ - fat of low fat milk (%)
- $S_f$ - supply from each farm (L)
- $F_f$ - fat from each farm (%)

### Variables
- $P_{wf}$ - Production of normal whole milk from each farm (L)
- $P_{owf}$ - Production of organic whole milk from each farm (L)
- $P_{olf}$ - Production of organic low fat milk from each farm (L)

### Objective function
The goal is to maximise the sum of products of the production of each type of milk and the corresponding unit price.
$$max(\sum_{f \in Farms} C_w \times P_{wf} + C_l \times (S_f-P_{wf}-P_{olf}-P_{owf}) + O_w \times P_{owf} + O_l \times P_{olf})$$

### Constraints
- The supplied milk is processed into whole milk and low fat milk so that the total milk fat content of production at most the total milk fat of supply - excess milk fat can be potentially used for other causes.
$$\sum_{f \in Farms} F_w \times (P_{wf}+P_{owf}) + F_l \times (S_f-P_{wf}-P_{owf}) \leq \sum_{f \in Farms} S_f \times F_f$$

- A fat cap on organic milk, as organic products must use only organic supply
$$\sum_{f \in Farms} F_w \times P_{owf} + F_l \times P_{olf} \leq \sum_{f \in O_f} S_f \times F_f$$

- The production of organic whole milk from a farm should be at most its supply minus its production of organic low fat milk, if it's an organic farm.
$$\forall f \in F,\; 0 \leq P_{owf} \leq S_f \times O_f-P_{olf}$$

- The production of normal whole milk from a farm should be at most its supply minus its production of organic milk - both whole & low fat.
$$\forall f \in F,\; 0 \leq P_{wf} \, \leq S_f-P_{owf}-P_{olf}$$

- The low fat milk can make up at most 25% of the total of low fat and whole milk, for each of organic and normal products.
$$\sum_{f \in F} P_{owf} \geq 3  \times  \sum_{f \in F} P_{olf}$$
$$\sum_{f \in F} P_{wf} \geq 3  \times  \sum_{f \in F} (S_f-P_{wf}-P_{owf}-P_{olf})$$

- Organic products can make up at most 15% of all milk sold.
$$\sum_{f \in F} (P_{owf}+P_{olf}) \leq 0.15  \times  \sum_{f \in F} S_f$$
