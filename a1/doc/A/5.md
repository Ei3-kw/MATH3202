## Communication 5

### Sets
- $F$ - set of supplying farms 
- $D$ - set of days

### Data
- $W_{w}$ - wholesale price of whole milk ($/L)
- $W_{l}$ - wholesale price of low fat milk ($/L)
- $F_{w}$ - fat content of whole milk (%)
- $F_{l}$ - fat content of low fat milk (%)
- $C_{s}$ - cost of storage ($/L/day)

- $Dw_{t}$ - demand for whole milk each day (L)
- $Dl_{t}$ - demand for low fat milk each day (L)
- $S_{f}$ - supply from each farm $f \in F$ (L)
- $F_{f}$ - fat content of milk from each farm $f \in F$ (%)

### Variables
- $x_{tf}$ - volume of whole milk produced from farm $f \in F$ on day $t \in D$ (L)
- $y_{tf}$ - volume of low fat milk produced from farm $f \in F$ on day $t \in D$ (L)

- $z_{t}$ - volume of whole milk stored on day $t \in D$ (L)
- $w_{t}$ - volume of low fat milk stored on day $t \in D$ (L)

- $a_{t}$ - total volume of whole milk sold on day $t \in D$ (L)
- $b_{t}$ - total volume of low fat milk sold on day $t \in D$ (L)

### Objective function
The goal of the program is to determine the volume of each variety of milk that needs to be processed to achieve a maximal profit and hence establish what this optimal profit is. 
$$
\textrm{max} \bigg( \sum_{t \in D} 
    W_{w} \times  a_{t} + 
    W_{l} \times  b_{t} - 
    (z_{t} + w_{t}) \times C_{s} \bigg)
$$

### Constraints
- Each day, for each of the milk varieties, teh volume of sold milk cannot exceed the demand for that variety. 
$$a_{t} \leq Dw_{t}, \quad \forall \; t \in D$$
$$b_{t} \leq Dl_{t}, \quad \forall \; t \in D$$

- The total milk processed each day from each farm is less than or equal to that farm's daily supply  
$$x_{tf} + y_{tf} \leq S_{f}, \quad \forall \; f \in F, \; t \in D$$

- The cumulatively fat content of processed milk is less than or equal to the fat content of supply
$$\sum_{f \in F} \big( F_{w} \times x_{tf} + F_{l} \times y_{tf} \big) \leq \sum_{f \in F} S_{f} \times F{f}$$


*Monday:*
- On mondays, for each milk variety, the volume of stored milk must equal processed milk minus sold milk 
$$
z_{t} = \bigg( \sum_{f \in F} x_{tf} \bigg) - a_{t}, \quad \forall \; t \in D, \quad \textrm{ and } \quad
w_{t} = \bigg( \sum_{f \in F} y_{tf} \bigg) - b_{t}, \quad \forall \; t \in D
$$

*Other Days:*
- On days other than monday, for each milk variety, the volume of stored milk must equal the sum of the processed milk from that day and stored milk from the previous day (this makes up all available milk to be sold) minus sold milk 
$$
z_{t} = \bigg( \sum_{f \in F} x_{tf} \bigg) + z_{t-1} - a_{t}, \quad \forall \; t \in D, \quad \textrm{ and } \quad w_{t} = \bigg( \sum_{f \in F} y_{tf} \bigg) + w_{t-1} - b_{t}, \quad \forall \; t \in D
$$

- For each milk variety, the total sold milk must be greater than or equal to the stored milk from the previous day (as this milk has to be sold and cannot remain in storage)
$$
a_{t} = z_{t-1}, \quad \forall \; t \in D, \quad \textrm{ and } \quad b_{t} = w_{t-1}, \quad \forall \; t \in D
$$
