Thank you for bringing these marketing restrictions to our attention. In response to these restrictions, we have revised our model. 

We have added constraints on the percentage of production which can be low fat for each of organic and non-organic products. Further, it is constrained that no more that 15% of production is organic. 

## Conclusion

Based on our model, the optimal income from the given supply under current regulation is $45967.50. The following table is a plan that would achieve such income.

### Table1.1.1 - hijo
\begin{tabular}{l|llllll}
                               & \textbf{Barnwood} & \textbf{Thistlebrook} & \textbf{Rustic Ranch} & \textbf{Haven} & \textbf{Silo Springs} & \textit{\textbf{Total}} \\ \hline
\textbf{Organic Whole Milk}    & 0                 & 0                     & 0                     & 0              & 4556.25               & 4556.25                 \\
\textbf{Organic Low Fat Milk}  & 0                 & 0                     & 0                     & 1518.75        & 0                     & 1518.75                 \\
\textbf{Standard Whole Milk}   & 6293.75           & 0                     & 9300                  & 7681.25        & 2543.75               & 25818.75                \\
\textbf{Standard Low Fat Milk} & 3306.25           & 5300                  & 0                     & 0              & 0                     & 8606.25                
\end{tabular}

The revised model suggests that from the total supply, 4556.25L of whole organic milk, 1518.75L of low fat organic milk, 25818.75L of whole milk and 8606.25L of low fat milk is processed.


## Sensitivity Analysis
Due to stringent regulations, a significant portion of organic milk supply is diverted for the production of non-organic milk, thereby compromising overall income for producers. Total income would increase $81 per 1% up until 40.25% (23.37%) to reach the maximal value of $48012.50 ($46645.47)

To mitigate this issue, actions can be taken to loosen the regulations, such as advocating for an increase in the percentage of organic milk allowed and collaborating with decision-makers. Additionally, promoting organic farms could bolster support for organic milk production.

We do not have information regarding the cost of producing organic VS non organic milk. If the cost is higher for organic milk, it is advisable to reduce the organic supply under current regulation - organic products can make up at most 15% of all milk sold.



<!-- The current model is established bit by bit through the first communications.  -->

<!-- Since low fat milk sells for more than whole milk, in Comm 1 it would have been great to make as much low fat milk as possible. However, since most farms gave milks that were around 3.6% fat, you would have had a lot of unused fat to throw away. Hence for Comm 1 (and Comm 2) you were required to use all the fat that came from the farms in your products.

Comm 3 says you can relax that constraint so that it is fine to have unused milk fat. The statement from the client could be rewritten to say "the total milk fat in organic and normal products can now be less than that in each of their inputs", giving the excess milk fat. -->
